# Setup

## Dependencies

Before starting, you should ensure you have the following available on your machine:

* An active MongoDB instance.
* Node.js

On Mac OS X or a RHEL/Fedora derivative you can install it like so:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY
./setup.sh
```

If you're on Windows, or feel like having a VM to work on, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) try using our `Vagrantfile`:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY
vagrant up      # Start the VM.
vagrant ssh     # Shell into the VM.
vagrant halt    # Stop the VM.
vagrant destroy # Delete the VM.
```

## Starting

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY
npm install # Install Dependencies into `.node_modules/`.
npm start   # Start the application.
```

# Deploy

There is a `Dockerfile` for use in deployment, however your mileage may vary.

# Troubleshooting

## Making certificates

In order to not have to accept a new cert every time, bake your own. [Source](https://library.linode.com/security/ssl-certificates/self-signed).

```bash
mkdir ./cert
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out ./cert/server.crt -keyout ./cert/server.key
chmod 600 ./cert/*
```

                    <h3>Polypharmacy Project</h3>

                    <p>Polypharmacy is frequently in the news as concern continues to grow about the risks of taking
                        multiple medications, particularly in our elderly and frail elderly populations. The PDC and
                        Shared Care Committee, working with small groups of physicians in the community, will use
                        real-time prescribing data to augment educational sessions aimed at improving medication
                        prescribing practices.</p>
